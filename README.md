DESCRIPTION : This project involves building a simple rule-based chatbot named CodBot using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot is designed to interact with users through the command line by responding to basic greetings and questions with predefined answers. To understand the user's input, the program performs basic natural language processing (NLP) steps such as converting text to lowercase, removing punctuation, tokenizing sentences into words, and lemmatizing each word using NLTK's WordNetLemmatizer. It then checks if the cleaned input matches any predefined keywords and returns the corresponding response. If no match is found, a default message is shown. The chatbot runs continuously in a loop until the user types “bye,” “exit,” or “quit.” Through this task, key NLP concepts and tools such as tokenization and lemmatization were applied to build a functional, text-based conversational agent.
